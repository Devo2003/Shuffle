# Shuffle

I think the way he is refactoring is because he is trying to spread out some things out instead of keeping everything in one method or trying to follow the seperation of concern
A way I would refactor this code for the first part of the video is that the person is using too much of the static keyword making his code become less maintainable and everything becomes a constant leaving no room for easy changes if someone else comes and edits his code so I would try to refactor it similar to my personal shuffle code where I barely use any static for any of my methods.

Part 2
For the second part of the video some of these changes look like they are being made so that the code looks more readable in english. In my opinion with the refactoring he did ] was a bit too much the naming coventions of certain varibles are too long so at that point you might want to use comments at that point. Another thing is if the app is only created to do a simple and nothing more some of the refactoring wouldnt be needed like when he created a class for just a small piece of code seems too much, but if there are to be expansion of the app then I can agree why somethings were changed, but he still uses static too much making it hard to do future changes without having to put static on evrything.

Some other changes to the project would be changing some names when it comes to the objects he is using. For me it was confusing to read through when t came down to the i equal j and then to temp. Once I created mine I was able to follow how eveyrthing worked out in that method.

From what I see the only major diffrence would be that the shuffling is still being made, but the way the shuffle order is different this one from the lowest index and swaps the highest where the other one swaped and index from the middle and another one from the highest index. I do prefer the first version because less things are being passed in to the constructor so its easier for me to read and follow what is what doing.
